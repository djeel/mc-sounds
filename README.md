# MC Sounds

A modern web audio player to explore, listen to, and organize all Minecraft Java Edition sounds, with a premium user experience (React + Tailwind).

## Main Features

- **Global floating audio player**: ergonomic, modern, with queue, drag & drop, favorites, loop, stop, minimize, close, resize, etc.
- **Drag & drop**: add sounds to the player queue from any list (categories, favorites, search) with no duplicates, including visual feedback.
- **Instant search** and filtering by category or favorites.
- **Persistent favorites** (localStorage), easy and fast management.
- **Display of durations** and source paths for each sound.
- **UI/UX**: responsive design, dark mode, visual feedback on all buttons, smooth transitions, perfect alignment.
- **Player queue**: reorderable, clickable, adaptive.
- **Minimize/close/restore** the player: always accessible and non-intrusive.
- **Manual resize** of the player (top-left corner).
- **No server dependency**: fully static, works locally or on any static hosting.
